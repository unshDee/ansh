# I Built a Website

When I set out to build a website inspired by Swiss design philosophy, I didn’t realize how transformative the process would be. It was my first time using Angular 19, paired with TailwindCSS for styling, and the experience turned out to be both challenging and rewarding.

Swiss design, also known as the $\text{International Typographic Style}$, emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and functionality.

## Design Resources

- [Swiss Design](https://www.design.swiss/): A treasure trove of inspiration for creating clean and simple designs. The website's examples influenced the overall layout of my pages.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img alt="simple, clean; design.swiss made me focus on grids" height="180" src="/src/content/images/design-swiss.png" title="Homepage of design.swiss" width="320"/>
</div>

- [Swiss Colors](https://fabianburghardt.de/swisscolors/): Helped me finalize my color palette. I went with a classic combination of blues and whites for a calm, professional aesthetic. I might add a secondary theme in the future.

- [Swiss Web Design Guide](https://youtu.be/qdHipyZgOTY?si=pQ7t1XAlPeYUK03I): This video gave me a deeper understanding of applying Swiss design principles to web development.

- [Swiss Design for the Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06WMy5jsjIg&t=231s&pp=ygUUc3dpc3MgZGVzaWduIHdlYnNpdGU%3D): A practical guide that helped me refine the visual and functional aspects of my site.

## What’s Next?

Maybe I'll add another theme to the website, possibly inspired by vibrant Swiss posters, to give an alternative visual experience. There’s also room for experimenting with animations and dynamic interactions to make the site more engaging.
